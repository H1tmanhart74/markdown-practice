# Why you shouldn't buy Electric Cars
<a name="Top-page"></a>

In todays market we are seeing a boom in electric cars as many people believe that it is a good way to go green and help the environment. This is not the case.\
Electric cars are not as good as they are made to be. The big benefits or points that people make and we see being passed around is electric cars are green and can save the environment. While the car itself is 100% green the building process that goes into electric cars is hurting the environment. Thus making it so every person who bought an electric car has to drive it for years to break even with the emissions that it took to build it.\

### Reasons not to get electric cars

1. they arn't good
    - poor manufacturing
2. doesn't help the environment
3. it would take years in order to break even

## Note

**This is important**
