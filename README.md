# Why you shouldn't consider buying Electric Cars
<a name="Top-page"></a>

In todays market we are seeing a boom in electric cars as many people believe that it is a good way to go green and help the environment. This isn't entirely the case.\
Electric cars have three big problems with them, manufacturing the battery, charging infrastructure, and proper recycling of the battery.

 One of the **biggest** issues from electric cars is getting materials for the battery. Currently we still use fossil fuels on heavy machinery to mine the materials made for making battery's. This produces a ton of emissions which is harmful for the environment. While the car itself is _100%_ green the building process for the battery that goes into electric cars isn't and need change in order to help the environment.

 > Mining in general is **bad** for the environment but that is a whole other topic.

 The charging infrastructure plays a important role for electric cars. This is their main source of "fuel" and is where you would go to charge your car. With people buying new electric cars power companies have struggled to manage how many cars can be plugged in to these infrastructures while giving power to peoples homes. Since some electric cars aren't ready for long distance travel there needs to be many of these infrastructures to make electric cars viable to go long distance. Building these buildings not only uses a lot of power it also costs money and uses heavy machinery which causes lots of emissions.

 We need proper recycling procedures when the cars battery can't sustain charge.

 are not as good as they are made to be. The big benefits or points that people make and we see being passed around is electric cars are green and can save the environment. Mainly the battery that goes into an electric car is causing a divide. .\

### Main reasons not to get a electric car

1. The battery production harms the environment
    - There is a lot of pollution that comes from getting the materials necessary to building the battery.
    - Every person who bought an electric car has to drive it for years to break even with the emissions that it took to build it.
2. charging infrastructure
3. proper recycling of the battery
    - Without properly disposing of the battery it could lead to harmful chemicals getting in the ground.
